			 	<h1>Day Eleven</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Dec 14, 2016</span>
			      <p>Today was supposed to be fast forward coding. Tomorrow we are setting up the big projector for the projection mapping installation in the atrium of Chester Beatty Library. By then my Raspberry Pi based solution has to be ready for mapping. That was the goal for today.</p>

<p>Most of the day I spent at the Chester Beatty reading room. Few days ago I noticed how beautifull the ceiling are there. It is the perfect room for coding culture and art projects. It has good internet connection, beautiful ceiling and it is quiet. If somebody has to say something there, whispering is the loudest you get.</p>

<p>I was building the projection mapping solution by keeping in mind that things should work. Test first, think through, solve problems before they arise. Many small decisions have to made in a process like this. How many images? What would be the perfect size of the image files? How big is the canvas? Naming of the variables. Small steps. Tests.</p>

<p>After I managed to write a simple script which would automatically populate virtual rectangles from an image file, Chester Beatty was closing and I changed my location to the Chocolate Factory. There I managed to get a few more steps done. Hunger started to manifest its existence and I decided to go home.</p>

<p>The last part for today was to create base configuration for mapping tomorrow. I transfered code to one of my Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s and connected it to a projector. The code compiled without problems and soon I had the reason to be satisfied. Ready for tomorrow. It is going to be fun.</p>
