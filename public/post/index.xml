      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good day. This is my first post regarding my residency at the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland. The residency starts next week and there are still a lot of things to prepare for it. During the residency I will give several Projection Mapping with the Raspberry Pi workshops and build a projection mapping installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited about the upcoming workshop at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tog.ie/&#34;&gt;TOG hackerspace&lt;/a&gt; next Monday, 5 December 2016. It is going to be an introduction to the world of projection mapping through Raspberry Pi and open source software. Follow TOG to not miss detailed information about what time it is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all I am very excited about the residency. I like the concept of the Maker in Residence programme which is also about opening museum spaces for makerspace and hackerspace activities.&lt;/p&gt;
