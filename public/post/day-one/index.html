			 	<h1>Day One</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 5, 2016</span>
			      <p>Leaving Berlin early in the morning to go to Dublin as today is the first official day of my residency. After a beautiful, cold and foggy night in Berlin, thick and crisp rime ice was covering objects left in the open. Morning sun casted long shadows and the white coated objects seemed twice as far away as they seem normally.</p>

<p>Jenny, Head of Education at the Chester Beatty Library, was waiting for me at the Dublin Airport. The flight got delayed and she had to wait for one extra hour. We were supposed to have a meeting with Jessica, Head of Collections &amp; Conservation at the Chester Beatty Library, to outline the possible collaboration in terms of the content being used for the projection mapping installation part of the residency. We also met Justyna, Education Assistant at the Chester Beatty Library. Justyna and Jenny introduced me to other people working at the institution. In the photo from left: Justyna, Jessica and Justyna.</p>

<p>I was very happy to see the printed material regarding the projection mapping installation that will be visible at the atrium of the Chester Beatty Library from 16th to 18th December 2016. I hope that that this kind of digital approach will reveal new perspectives to the people involved in the life of the museum. Sometimes it is a matter of showing a working prototype and further ideas might go into unexpected directions. Curious.</p>
