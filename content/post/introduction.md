Good day. This is my first post regarding my residency at the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland. The residency starts next week and there are still a lot of things to prepare for it. During the residency I will give several Projection Mapping with the Raspberry Pi workshops and build a projection mapping installation. 

I am very excited about the upcoming workshop at the [TOG hackerspace](https://www.tog.ie/) on 12 December 2016. It is going to be an introduction to the world of projection mapping through Raspberry Pi and open source software. Follow [TOG](https://twitter.com/TOG_Dublin) to not miss detailed information about what time it is going to happen.

All in all I am very excited about the residency. I like the concept of the Maker in Residence programme which is also about opening museum spaces for makerspace and hackerspace activities.
