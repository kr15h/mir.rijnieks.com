Yesterday I made some sketches of the projection mapping installation in the atrium of the Chester Beatty Library. I am going to use six mini-projectors and six Raspberry Pi's which will run a data-driven visual application. Images of the various artifacts of the Chester Beatty Library collection will be used to fill the database.
